        <p class="tutor-div-content">
            To be an online tutor you need to have a good grasp of the concepts in the subject you want to tutor in. Having the ability to relate topics to real-world examples and explain them to the students helps students understand how they can apply what they are learning.
  Good communication skills and lots of patience are essential too. Sometimes it is very difficult to tutor someone online who might not have the basic foundation for the particular subject. As the tutor, you have to detect, adapt, and teach to the student so that they can fully understand the concept.
